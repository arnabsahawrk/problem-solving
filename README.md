This repository is a personal record of my competitive programming and problem-solving journey.  
It contains **solutions, notes, and experiments from solving 2000+ problems** across different platforms over a long period of consistent practice.

More than just solutions, this repo reflects how I learned to **think algorithmically**, improve my **problem-solving speed**, and build strong **data structures and algorithms fundamentals**.

- A notebook of my **daily problem-solving practice**
- Solutions written with learning in mind, not just AC
- Gradual improvement through contests, failures, and revisions
- Exposure to a wide range of problem types and patterns

I started with basics like **arrays and strings**, then moved into areas such as **hashing, sorting, greedy**, and eventually more advanced topics like **dynamic programming, trees, graphs, binary search, heaps, sliding window, backtracking, union find**, and more.

I practice in multiple languages depending on the problem and context:

- **C++** (primary)
- Python
- C
- JavaScript
- TypeScript

This helped me understand trade-offs between performance, readability, and implementation speed.

During this journey, I participated in **80+ contests** across different platforms and reached the following milestones:

- **Codeforces** — Pupil

Problem-solving taught me how to:
- Break down complex problems
- Recognize patterns
- Write efficient and maintainable code
- Stay patient and persistent
