What are the types of Entity Attribute?

There are five main types of attributes:


1. Simple Attribute (Cannot be divided into smaller parts.)  -> `Name`, `Age`, `Gender`  

2. Composite Attribute (Can be divided into smaller sub-parts that have their own meaning.) -> `FullName` → (`FirstName`, `LastName`), `Address` → (`Street`, `City`, `ZIP`)

3. Derived Attribute (Value can be derived from another attribute.) -> `Age` (derived from `DateOfBirth`) Age() 
                                        
4. Multi-Valued Attribute (An entity can have multiple values for that attribute.) -> `PhoneNumbers`, `Degrees`, `EmailAddresses` {PhoneNumbers}                                  

5. Key Attribute (A unique identifier for an entity — used to distinguish one entity from another.) -> `Student_ID`, `Employee_ID`
